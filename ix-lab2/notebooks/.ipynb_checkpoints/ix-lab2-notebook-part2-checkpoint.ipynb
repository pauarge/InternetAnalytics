To avoid long cells of codes in the notebook, you can also embed long python functions and classes in a separate module. Donâ€™t forget to hand in your module if that is the case. In multiple exercises, you are required to come up with your own method to solve various problems. Be creative and clearly motivate and explain your methods. Creativity and clarity will be considered for grading.*"

    "1. My estimation is quite far from the actual average (43 vs 21). Therefore, my estimation overrepresents young users.\n",

The selection of the next user to explore from the current users friends should no be a \"blind\" random, but should have some kind of bias to compensate the lower likelihood of nodes with small degree to be selected. The implementation has been done using an unbiased estimator such in the course slides."
